## Purpose

**Rust XPLM** provides a convenient interface for X-Plane plugin development in the Rust programming language for all
platforms.

As we use the [X-Plane SDK](https://developer.x-plane.com/sdk/) version 3.0, any plugin created with this library
supports X-Plane version 11.10 or later.

## Status

The library is still in an incomplete state. As a result some parts of the SDK may only be sparsely covered or missing
completely.

- [x] Compiles and is callable from X-Plane
- [x] Debug logging to the console / log file
- [x] DataRef reading and writing
- [x] Commands
- [ ] GUI - Needs further work
- [ ] Drawing - Needs further work

## Example

Some more examples can be found in the `examples/` directory.

This small snipped, however, is the minimal boilerplate needed to make your plugin compile.

```rust
extern crate xplm;

use xplm::plugin::{Plugin, PluginInfo};
use xplm::{debugln, xplane_plugin};

struct MinimalPlugin;

impl Plugin for MinimalPlugin {
    type Error = std::convert::Infallible;

    fn start() -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        // The following message should be visible in the developer console and the Log.txt file
        debugln!("Hello, World! From the Minimal Rust Plugin");
        Ok(MinimalPlugin)
    }

    fn info(&self) -> PluginInfo {
        PluginInfo {
            name: String::from("Minimal Rust Plugin"),
            signature: String::from("org.samcrow.xplm.examples.minimal"),
            description: String::from("A plugin written in Rust"),
        }
    }
}

xplane_plugin!(MinimalPlugin);
```
